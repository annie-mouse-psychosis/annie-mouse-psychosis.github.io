# Psychosis blog
The repository is publicly viewable, but is not intended to be forked/shared/etc.  I don't care to prevent it, and what is available may help someone.  However, I have no plans to review pull requests or support someone trying to fork and use it for their own blog (but that doesn't mean I won't try).
