I've struggled with psychosis, with little to no mental health treatment, for two decades.  I am beginning treatment with a plan to unabashedly tell the psychiatrist everything.  My previous stint with treatment had paranoia and delusions preventing me from giving all the information.  This led to ineffectual treatment.

I am writing this partially as an exercise of motivation to myself and partially to chronicle my experiences.  It will include what I remember of psychotic episodes in the past, current symptoms I have and the ways I have been coping over the years.  This is not a universal picture into psychosis, it is an intimate portrayal of my psychosis.

I recently received my diagnosis, but it's not firm.  The doctor said that it is very likely schizotypal, but many doctors would classify it as schizophrenia.  The diagnosis doesn't change treatment, so is unimportant except for grouping or putting a name to my symptoms.
