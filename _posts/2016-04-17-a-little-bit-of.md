## How am l doing?
I currently have what can easily be described as a dream job.  My boss is always pleased with the work I do and my team regularly expresses how much better things are now that l have taken over.  I have a large amount of flexibility and responsibility at work.  I'm paid well and enjoy what l do.  I honestly can't believe the situation I'm in.

I'm happily married to the woman of my dreams, have several wonderful pets, own a house, car, furniture and clothes.  I am, honestly, in a place where there is nothing that l want that I cannot have.  Part of it is to not want for much, there are things we do not have that others do, but we do not have a desire for those things.

I'm coming apart at the seams, I'm constantly mentally exhausted from fighting off my demons.  Our lives are too busy for me to just check out regularly.  As I get older, and have more that I must do, more people relying on me, how l cope is becoming insufficient.

## That all sounds normal. . .
I have nearly constant hallucinations, from background noise like standing at the mall to seeing creatures and things that do not exist to having the shadows and normal sounds twisted towards malevolence.  I have an ever present feeling of paranoia, at times reaching high levels of severity. I have delusions that, to my mind, if I share with someone, they will be exposed to <redacted>, putting them in danger.
