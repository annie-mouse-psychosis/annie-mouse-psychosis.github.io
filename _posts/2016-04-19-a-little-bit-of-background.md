## How am l doing?
I currently have what can easily be described as a dream job.  My boss is always pleased with the work I do and my team regularly expresses how much better things are now that l have taken over.  I have a large amount of flexibility and responsibility at work.  I'm paid well and enjoy what l do.  I honestly can't believe the situation I'm in.

I'm happily married to the person of my dreams, have several wonderful pets, own a house, car, furniture and clothes.  I am, honestly, in a place where there is nothing that l want that I cannot have.  Part of it is to not want for much, there are things we do not have that others do, but we do not have a desire for those things.

I'm coming apart at the seams, I'm constantly mentally exhausted from fighting off my demons.  Our lives are too busy for me to just check out regularly.  As I get older, and have more that I must do, more people relying on me, how l cope is becoming insufficient.

## That all sounds normal. . .
I have nearly constant hallucinations, from background noise like standing at the mall to seeing creatures and things that do not exist to having the shadows and normal sounds twisted towards malevolence.  I have an ever present feeling of paranoia, at times reaching high levels of severity. I have delusions that, to my mind, if I share with someone, they will be exposed to <redacted>, putting them in danger.

And that's not all, it takes large amounts of mental effort, unseen, unknown and not understood by others, just to try and function like a person.  I can't manage to to pay bills, my spouse takes care of that because I can't keep track of what day of the month it is.  Motivation is a huge issue.  I want to do things, like take a shower, or play video games, or watch a TV show, but the mental effort I need to go through to get started, to prepare, seems overwhelming and frequently I don't manage to prepare myself until it's too late to do it that day.

## So how DO you cope?
In subsequent posts I'll cover more specific coping mechanisms I use, but I wanted to give a quick overview.  The hardest part is that outwardly acknowledging symptoms makes it harder for me to dismiss things that aren't real (be it hallucinations, paranoia or delusions).

### Hallucinations
If I'm alone, there is no common/shared reality.  I have had incidents with hallucinations where I was injured in a manner that matched my interaction with the hallucination.  I discard things that don't matter and play the odds for things big enough to matter (a 10 year old girl riding a bicycle with training wheels on a 4 lane highway 30 miles from a town is exceedingly unlikely, so I ignore it's existence).

If I'm around strangers or people I can't trust, I have to be vigilant watching their reactions.  If something is there or occurring, I watch for their reactions.  No reactions, might not be real.  Discussing something related to it may cause a reaction that confirms it.

If I'm around someone I trust, I do the same as around strangers, but I have a "grounding rod".  They know I'm keeping an eye on everything, so they point out more, or ask if I start focusing on odd things.  I can also ask if something is real.
